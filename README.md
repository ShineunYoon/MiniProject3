# MiniProject3

For this miniproject, I followed the tutorial of building an Weather app provided by Aman Mittal.

1. REACT Native Application

Compared to the my experience developing different applications (Android,iOS and etc), React Native has shown an advantage on the fastest build-run speed. And it was convenient to see the results due to changes directly on app just saving the source code. However, it would be better to find other platforms to build a heavy app with a lots of imported libraries. This is because the code became less intuitive for understanding. Moreover, seperation between display feature and function were less clear.


1. Automated test using AWS test factory

  - AWS Device Farm
    This service allows you to test user-built app with multiple physical devices in parallel on the AWS Cloud.
    
    Following screenshots shows the configurations I used for testing:
